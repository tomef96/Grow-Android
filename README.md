### A streamlined app for people aspiring to build muscle and get lean  
**The idea**: A fitness app which works in a way a real life personal trainer works. It would give the customer a workout plan which is actually science based and tailored to the customers need and optionally a meal plan or nutrition guidelines to follow. Not only would it give the customer an initial setup, it would monitor the work done by the user and **adjust the plan based on user progress**. This could take form in changing weights, sets, rep ranges, exercise selection and adding rehab exercises if the user experience pain or weakness in the body. These plans would be tracked and performed in the easiest manner possible, preferably by the touch of a button. Ease of tracking is especially appreciated when someone is working out, you don’t want to use energy on navigating a quirky user interface when you’re focusing on lifting weights. Optimally the phone would not even have to be unlocked, you could just confirm the set is done by using a “music-like” interface on a locked screen. The keyword in this idea is **muscle made easy**.


**Why is this a good idea?:** Numerous “workout-apps” exists today, some of them are pretty good too. But of the many apps i’ve tried, they always lacked the kind of guided progression and science based workouts i’m proposing. They would just ask you to pick a random program or eventually enter your preferred workout routine, much like a simple notepad application with filters. I see the need for an truly smart app which make it easy for users to get started and keep going, **stronger and pain free**. While existing apps often have an open design where users can put in whatever they want, my vision is a strict system where **the app decides what the user will do**, based on actual experience and knowledge from personal trainers, physiotherapists and other **science based sources**. In my mind, this will always be better than letting a potentially inexperienced user go crazy on potentially hazardous exercises or exercises with limited potential. Today the amount of people aspiring to get better bodies increases with every day. Fit bodies are in like never before and the market is ripe for the picking (Thanks, social media).
